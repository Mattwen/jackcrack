Brute force your way into JackBox.tv rooms using a WordList and nature of probability. Kinda pointless, but still fun.

    Run jackbox_gen.py first to generate a wordList and add your own userID instead

    Then run jackcrack.py to get room numbers

Change your concurrent value to something lower on slower computers.
